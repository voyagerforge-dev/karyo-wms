# Karyo WMS - local reproduction of the CI `scan` job
#
# Builds the karyo-app fast-jar and image, then scans it under the SAME GATE
# .github/workflows/ci.yml applies, so a dependency bump can be measured before it
# is pushed. The invocation is not byte-identical - CI renders its table from a
# single `trivy image` run, this scans once to JSON and renders the gate from that
# report with `trivy convert` (see the note on that command below). What IS copied
# from the workflow deliberately is the equivalence that matters: the same severity
# filter, the same --exit-code 1, and the same `:ro,Z` mount. They are the gate, not
# a knob, and this script must not be more permissive than CI.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/scan-image.sh                 build, scan, print the table
#   ./scripts/scan-image.sh --json out.json build, scan, also write raw JSON
#   ./scripts/scan-image.sh --no-build      scan the last image this script built
#
# Notes:
#   * --pull=always on the image build. The base tag (eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine)
#     floats, and a stale local base makes the report worse than CI's for reasons
#     that have nothing to do with the repository. Measured 2026-09-05: a cached
#     base reported 7 CRITICAL / 64 HIGH where a freshly pulled one reported
#     2 CRITICAL / 36 HIGH on the identical tree.
#   * `:ro,Z` on the bind mount, not `:ro`. SELinux is Enforcing on the CI host and
#     on Fedora workstations; a bare :ro is denied inside the scanning container and
#     Trivy dies with a message that reads like a file-permission problem. See the
#     comment on the same step in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#   * --timestamp 0, matching the image CI builds. quarkusBuild restamps every
#     dependency jar with the build time, so without it the 94 MiB lib/ layer gets a
#     fresh digest on every build and layer deduplication stops working. It is not a
#     scan concern, but this script must build the image CI builds, not a variant of
#     it, or the report describes something nobody ships.
#   * JAVA_HOME must point at a JDK. A system JRE has no javac and Gradle will fail.

# One scan, two renderings. The image is scanned once into JSON and the gating table

# `convert` reads the report and needs no DB, but it does need `--scanners`: that flag
# tells it which scanners produced the report, and without it the summary table is
# silently dropped with a "No enabled scanners found" WARN. It has to name BOTH, since
# `trivy image` defaults to vuln,secret - naming only vuln labels every secret-scanned
# target "-", which the table's own legend reads as "Not scanned". The severity filter
# and --exit-code 1 are still the gate and still match CI's.
