/**
 * Row 18 (myWMS `cleanupDeleted`): hard-removes stock units left in DELETABLE(1000) past the
 * retention window, then the unit loads they leave empty.
 *
 * `StockState.DELETABLE(1000)` is a real lifecycle state and terminal entities have a
 * physical-removal mechanism. The public contract is
 * `docs/functional/inventory-operations.md#5-stock-lifecycle-and-purge`. Stock-unit cleanup is
 * explicit because `stock_units.unit_load_id` is a real foreign key, so stock rows must be
 * removed before their unit load can be removed.
 *
 * This deliberately does not call [UnitLoadService.delete]. That method counts dependents with
 * `StockUnitRepository.findByUnitLoadId` and does not filter by state, so it throws
 * `HasDependents` on precisely the unit loads [UnitLoadTerminator.trashIfEmpty] produces (their
 * soft-deleted stock rows still physically exist until this service removes them). The ordering
 * here -- stock rows first, then the unit load -- is what makes the removal possible at all.
 *
 * Order of operations per [clientId] (rewritten in fix round 2, I3, defect-burndown-5 --
 * see adjudication A9): read the retention window from SC16, select up to [batchSize]
 * DELETABLE candidates older than the cutoff, subtract every [PurgeBlockerLookup]'s
 * [PurgeBlockerLookup.blockedStockUnitIds] (ONE call per lookup for the whole batch, never
 * per-candidate -- batching discipline holds even though the deletes below no longer share a
 * transaction with this read), then journal + outbox + delete each survivor in its OWN new JTA
 * transaction ([QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew]). Then do the same for up to [batchSize]
 * terminal, zero-stock unit loads and [PurgeBlockerLookup.blockedUnitLoadIds]. A blocked
 * candidate is counted and skipped without ever starting a transaction for it. A candidate whose
 * own transaction throws is caught, logged at WARN, and counted in [PurgeResult.failed] --
 * neither purged nor blocked, so it is offered again (re-selected by the same query) on the next
 * `purge(clientId)` call, and a single consistently-failing candidate wedges only itself, never
 * the rest of the tenant's tick. [purge] itself carries no `@Transactional` of its own: the read
 * phase (candidate selection + blocker unions) is plain queries, and every write is inside one
 * of the per-candidate transactions instead. One consequence of that split, verified empirically
 * while building it: the read phase's persistence context does not automatically learn about a
 * delete performed inside a per-candidate [QuarkusTransaction.requiringNew] transaction, so a
 * successfully purged entity is explicitly `detach()`ed from the read phase's own context right
 * after -- otherwise its identity map would keep serving the now-deleted row to any later by-id
 * lookup within the same call.
 *
 * **Rows :1537/M5 (defect-burndown-5, adjudication A1):** before this sprint, shipped stock
 * never reached DELETABLE at all -- [DefaultStockPicker.shipContainer] left it at SHIPPED(680)
 * forever, so [StockUnitRepository.findPurgeCandidates]'s `state = DELETABLE` filter could never
 * select it and this reaper's stock-unit half was unreachable for anything that had shipped.
 * `shipContainer` now promotes SHIPPED stock to DELETABLE in the same transaction it ships, and
 * that promotion is what stamps `modified` -- so the retention window computed above now reads
 * exactly as "shipped stock purges N days after ship" for that stock, the same semantics it
 * already had for stock gone DELETABLE via [StockService.deleteStock] or a zero-count. Once the
 * stock rows are purged, the unit load they leave empty is picked up as a terminal-empty
 * candidate on a later tick, same as any other producer.
 *
 * **Unit-load half retry, fixed in round 2 (I2, defect-burndown-5).** [StockPurgeScheduler]'s
 * tenant loop used to be built only from [StockUnitRepository.clientIdsWithDeletableStock], so a
 * client whose only remaining purge work was a blocked terminal unit load (a live carrier child,
 * a shipping-unit reference, ...) was never revisited once the block cleared -- the unit-load
 * phase below was unreachable on any tick where that client had no DELETABLE stock candidate
 * left. [StockPurgeScheduler] now unions that tenant set with
 * [UnitLoadRepository.clientIdsWithEmptyTerminal], so every client with EITHER kind of purge
 * work is visited every tick, and a blocked unit load gets the same next-tick retry the
 * stock-unit half always had.
 *
 * Takes [clientId] explicitly, never an ambient TenantContext read: it is called from a
 * `@Scheduled` tenant loop ([StockPurgeScheduler]) which never primes one. See
 * `StockPurgeSchedulerIntegrationTest`.
