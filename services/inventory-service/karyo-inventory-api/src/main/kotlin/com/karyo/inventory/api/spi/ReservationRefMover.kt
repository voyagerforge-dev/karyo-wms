/**
 * Row 13: moves a stock unit's reservation *references* when the reserved amount itself moves
 * (`ReservationTransferService.transferReservation`). A reservation is not one row: the amount
 * lives on the stock unit here in inventory, while the order line's claim lives in the orders
 * module and the open pick's claim lives in fulfillment. All three must move inside one
 * transaction or none.
 *
 * Declared here and implemented by the foreign cores, the same direction as
 * [OpenPickGuard]: inventory owns the contract, so no module gains a dependency on another
 * module's core. Implementations are discovered as CDI beans and every one is called; SPI calls
 * join the caller's transaction, which is what makes the move atomic.
 *
 * Every method takes [clientId] explicitly rather than reading an ambient TenantContext, per the
 * standing doctrine for cross-module reads.
 *
 * defect-burndown-5 review fix (findings 1 and 3): a reservation's "live" figure and its
 * terminal/split bookkeeping are computed per **slice** -- a `(lineId, stockUnitId)` pair, the
 * SAME grouping key `OrderService.unhandledRemainders` folds by, because a slice can be backed by
 * MORE THAN ONE bookkeeping row (release-then-retry-reservation records a second row for the same
 * slice; see that method's KDoc). Folding by slice BEFORE subtracting the slice's terminal total
 * once is required for correctness: two rows of 15 each on a slice whose terminal total is 20
 * fold to 30, leaving 10 truly live -- subtracting 20 from EACH row independently (the pre-fix
 * shape) would floor both at zero and strand 10 units as permanently untransferable. [readSourceState]
 * computes this ONCE per transfer (one row fetch, one terminal-plan query) and the resulting
 * [ReservationSourceState] is threaded into both the guard checks and [moveRefs], so the
 * validated live figure and the actual row surgery are, by construction, the same computation --
 * never two independent ones that could drift apart.
