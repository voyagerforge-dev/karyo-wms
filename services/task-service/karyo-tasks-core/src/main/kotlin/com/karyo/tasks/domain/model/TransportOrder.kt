/**
 * A unit-load move (PUTAWAY, MOVE, REPLENISH, or — PT15 — TRANSFER, a chain successor).
 * Reuses the shared [OrderState] vocabulary from karyo-orders-api; the v1.2 subset is
 * CREATED(50) → RELEASED(100) → RESERVED(400, operator assigned) → STARTED(500) →
 * FINISHED(700), plus CANCELED(800) pre-STARTED.
 *
 * clientId (via [TenantEntity]) is the domain-owner attribute per silo tenancy.
 * Location/unit-load references are id+denormalized-name (no cross-module FKs).
 *
 * [executorType] is fixed to HUMAN in v1.2; the column exists so WCS/equipment routing
 * (not currently implemented) could populate it without a schema churn. [locationReservationId]
 * (unused as a stored FK — the layout module keys its reservation by transportOrderId)
 * is retained as a breadcrumb of the soft reservation held while the task is open.
