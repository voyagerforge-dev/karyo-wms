/**
 * Strategy-driven configuration: the binding seam for the order domain.
 *
 * Resolves *which* [com.karyo.orders.domain.model.OrderStrategy] (by name) applies to an
 * operation, given a [OrderStrategyContext]. Discovered as CDI beans and consulted in
 * ascending [priority] order; the **first non-null** name wins and short-circuits the rest.
 * The built-in [com.karyo.orders.service.DefaultOrderStrategyResolver] registers at the
 * **lowest priority** ([DEFAULT_PRIORITY], runs last), so any custom resolver at a lower
 * value pre-empts it. Returning `null` means "no opinion, fall through to the next resolver".
 *
 * Today the context carries only the direct `orderStrategyId` reference; future inputs
 * (orderType, wave) are added to [OrderStrategyContext] without breaking existing resolvers.
