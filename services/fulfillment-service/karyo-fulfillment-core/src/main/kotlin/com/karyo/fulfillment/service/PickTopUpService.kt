     * explicitly rather than the ambient [com.karyo.security.TenantContext] -- this call sits right
     * above [sourceAmountsFor]'s own explicit-`clientId` fix and gates whether that method is ever
     * reached at all for an order-bound top-up; leaving it ambient would silently reject every
     * planned pick (not merely misclassify them) whenever a future caller's thread doesn't prime
     * `TenantContext` to match [order]'s real owner.
