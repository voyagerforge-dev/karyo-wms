/**
 * PickOrder/Pick cancel lifecycle (WORKLIST row 14), split out of [PickOrderService] to keep that
 * file's detekt state untouched (fulfillment-core's one accepted finding lives there).
 *
 * Behavioral parity with myWMS's order-level force-finish and its per-line pick cancellation
 * (independent implementation). The resulting Karyo behavior is specified in
 * `docs/functional/picking.md`.
 * Deliberately NOT carried over: myWMS's `resetPickingOrder` split/regenerate machinery (Karyo's existing
 * `PickOrderService.release` already covers "interrupt and let anyone resume") and any `PAUSED`
 * state (myWMS never pauses a PickingOrder — sprint adjudication 1).
 *
 * **Order-level "FINISHED" is spelled PICKED here.** myWMS's force-finish lands the order on a
 * distinct FINISHED(700) code. Karyo's PickState has no such code — the existing terminal
 * completion state for a fully-worked PickOrder is already PICKED(600) (see
 * [PickOrderService.confirmPick]'s completion check). Force-finish's "some picks were kept" branch
 * reuses that identical terminal code; only the "nothing was ever picked" branch gets the distinct
 * CANCELED(800) code. This keeps a single terminal-completion representation for PickOrder rather
 * than inventing a parallel one.
 *
 * **Delivery-order reconciliation is deliberately NOT invoked here.** Unlike `confirmPick`, which
 * calls `OrderProgressionPort.markPicked` on order-level cancel completion, this service does not
 * drive [PickOrderRepository]'s `deliveryOrderId` order through any transition: the backing
 * DeliveryOrder's line rollups (`PickRollupLookup.sumPickedByLineIds`) already read PICKED picks
 * ONLY, so a canceled pick simply never contributes to `pickedAmount` — the derived rollup
 * self-corrects with no explicit call needed. The DeliveryOrder itself stays at STARTED (< PICKED)
 * after either cancel outcome (Karyo's terminal-completion state for a PickOrder canceled early
 * with picks kept is PICKED, but that call only advances the PICK ORDER, not the parent
 * DeliveryOrder — the DeliveryOrder still needs its own confirm/cancel path), which is exactly the
 * state range the existing DeliveryOrder-level cancel endpoint already gates on.

     * Force-finish cancel (adjudication 2): every open (pre-PICKED) pick is CANCELED with its
     * outstanding reservation released via [StockPicker.releaseUnpickedReservation] — the exact
     * path `PickOrderService.handleShortfall` already uses, so the release publishes the same
     * `AmountChanged`/RELEASE outbox row a short-pick release does. The order lands on
     * CANCELED if nothing was ever PICKED, else on PICKED (see class KDoc for why PICKED, not a
     * distinct FINISHED code). Refused (409) once the order is already at or past PICKED.
     *
     * Authorization mirrors [PickOrderService.release]'s asManager pattern: an unclaimed RELEASED
     * order (operatorId null) is cancelable by any fulfillment-write principal; a STARTED order
     * claimed by someone else needs [asManager].
     *
     * **Adjudicated ruling on the PICKED-reuse hazard (task-1-review finding #2):** a force-finish
     * that keeps at least one genuinely PICKED pick lands the order on PICKED and is therefore
     * `openPacking`-eligible ([PackingService.openPacking] gates purely on
     * `pickOrder.state == PickState.PICKED.code`). This is INTENTIONAL, myWMS-faithful behavior —
     * "you pack what was picked"; the short signal lives on the DeliveryOrder's derived line rollup
     * (`pickedAmount < ordered`), not on the PickOrder state machine. What made this safe to leave
     * alone is [keptPickedCount] being counted
     * correctly (see below): an order with ZERO genuinely-PICKED picks — whether never touched, or
     * every pick canceled per-line first — always lands on CANCELED, which `openPacking`'s gate
     * already refuses (`state != PICKED`). So the "empty/zero-picked shipment silently opens
     * packing" hazard the review raised cannot occur; only the "partial-but-nonempty" case can,
     * and that case is the accepted, correct force-finish behavior described above.
     *
     * **Refined 2026-07-31 (defect-burndown-2 final gate).** The ruling above still holds for a
     * force-finish reached through fulfillment's own REST cancel: PICKED-and-packable is correct.
     * What changed is the delivery-order cancel cascade, which force-finishes here while the
     * DeliveryOrder itself goes CANCELED — one call now produces CANCELED order + PICKED PickOrder.
     * That pair IS a gap, and it is closed on the packing side by
     * [PackingService.openPacking]'s canceled-order guard (keyed on the DeliveryOrder's state, not
     * the PickOrder's), leaving the PICKED-reuse semantics here untouched.

     * ownership check at all, unlike [cancelOrder] — an asymmetric hole that let any
     * fulfillment-write principal cancel individual picks of an order claimed by a different
     * operator.
