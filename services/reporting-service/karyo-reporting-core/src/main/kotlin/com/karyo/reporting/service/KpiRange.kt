/**
 * `D7`/`D30`/`D90` are pure durations (no calendar-day boundary), so they need no timezone.
 * `YTD`'s "start of this calendar year" is a day-boundary computation and must use the same
 * zone the KPI views bucket days in -- [WarehouseZone.ZONE] -- so a Jan-1-warehouse-local row
 * lands inside the YTD window even when UTC hasn't rolled to Jan 1 yet (or has already rolled
 * past Dec 31 warehouse-local). See [WarehouseZone] (`karyo-common`) for the full
 * warehouse-local day-bucketing decision (decided and fixed 2026-08-17, kpi-warehouse-tz).
